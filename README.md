# What it does and how it works

Creates landing pages based on content in templates files / sub folders. Create a template file and whatever dependencies needed will be transferred over to the newly created dist folder when you run index.php. Modifying the code will allow you to generate a landing page for every city in the united states, or you can specify you state and counties. Transfer contents of the dist folder to production for us.

# Usage 

1. Add your counties in generate.php
2. Add your state in generate.php
3. Add your site URL in gernate.php
4. Create template files
5. Run index.php

# Future Features

GUI that includes selection of all locations, remove all landing pages.
